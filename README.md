# Task Analytics

Python utilities for analysing task throughput and efficiency.

## Usage

Place your CSV exports inside a dated folder under `data/`, e.g. `data/04_Jun_2025/my_export_all.csv`.

Run the report by providing the date folder as an argument:

```bash
python src/report.py 04_Jun_2025
```

All graphs will be saved in the same folder as the CSV file.
